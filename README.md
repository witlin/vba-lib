Module 2
- In the **xxJobName_xxPhase_xxPanelVendor_Inv_YYYYMMDD_Author.xlsm** file, the summarize sub-routine takes all the rows from the inventory worksheet and tallies up the total part qty by PO #, while rolling up any other rows with the same part number into a single row on the summary work-sheet.
